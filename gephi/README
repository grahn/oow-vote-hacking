mix_voters.gephi - grahn's version
mix_voters_weighted_edges.gephi - used vote count as edge weight (grahn)
oow_voters.gephi - neilkod's first cut version


If you use MySQL you can use the following queries to import the data into Gephi.
I use user_id*10 for authors so the ids do not overlap - Gephi complained about this.

-- nodes query
-- get list of voters and authors
select a.user_id as id, a.name as label, 'voter' as type
from users a, all_votes b
where a.user_id = b.user_id
group by a.user_id, a.name
union all
select a.user_id *10 as id, a.name as label, 'author' as type
from users a, sessions b
where a.user_id = b.user_id
group by a.user_id, a.name

-- edges query 
-- voter = source, author = target
select a.user_id as source, b.user_id *10 as target, count(*) as weight
from all_votes a, sessions b
where a.session_id = b.session_id
group by 1,2
order by 3,1,2
